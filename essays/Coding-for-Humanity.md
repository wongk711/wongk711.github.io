## Right and Wrong

There are many (including myself) that believe that given a coding problem, there are many ways one could go about solving it. In fact, there are infinite ways someone could solve any given problem. There are many ways which could be considered right and many ways which could be considered wrong. I.e. did your program output the desired result to meet the requirements. However, it is not that simple when we look at the ethics of coding. In my words, ethics is a set of unspoken rules that we as humans must live by, if we want do what we love, and chase our dreams without feeling guilt, shame, or regret later on.

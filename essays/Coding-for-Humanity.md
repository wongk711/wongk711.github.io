## Right and Wrong

There are many (including myself) that believe that given a coding problem, there are many ways one could go about solving it. In fact, there are infinite ways someone could solve any given problem. There are many ways which could be considered right and many ways which could be considered wrong. I.e. did your program output the desired result to meet the requirements. However, it is not that simple when we look at the ethics of coding. In my words, ethics is a set of unspoken rules that we as humans must live by, if we want do what we love, and chase our dreams without feeling guilt, shame, or regret later on. 

### Case Study: "The code I'm still ashamed of"

In ["The code I'm still ashamed of"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/#.tsjl7lkxy), the writer is an experienced programmer who worked as a freelancer and then for a bigger pharmaceutical company. The article is not that long to read, and is very interesting regardless, but long story short he wrote code for a quiz to give to teenage girls that would reccommend a prescription drug for them to use based on their answers. In the end, he realized that based on the company's requirements, any quiz combination of answwers would lead to a reccmomendation of their drug. Little did he know there were known side effects of severe depression and thoughts of suicide. He later found out that one of the girls who took the drug committed suicide and died. The writer goes on to explain that resigned shortly after and still feels bad for the girl and for any other potential girls who have taken his quiz. It's a tough spot to be in, because on one hand your just writing the code. It could be thought of as translating a foreign language, or like the old saying goes, "don't shoot the messenger". It was not his requirements for recommending the drug no matter the quiz, however he did read the requirements and implement them. It's hard to say exactly what I would've done in his position, but I'd like to think I would ask what the drug does or if there any side effects, or even ask why all answer combinations lead to the same drug. But as the other saying goes, "hindsight is 20/20." 

### Future Ethics

The author went on to explain how in today's world humanity is relying more and more on software integration and sometimes even Ai Software to work for us and make judgements. I think the most crucial example would be symptom recognition and diagnosis. This would be lifechanging if done ethically and correctly, but it'd also be too easy to get greedy and recommend expensive drugs or treatments. I think in these coming times, we as coders and more importantly we as humans, must live by our ethics and moral code when we design tools for the future. We live in a world where a college student can change the world with one program like facebook. We go to school to learn how to write code to solve the given problema dn out put the desired result, but we must use our ethical judgement to write code that is good for humanity, and beneficial to society.

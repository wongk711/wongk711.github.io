## Life Online

With the pandemic of Covid-19 spreading across the world, so rapidly and with no cure/vaccine, the everyone's life is changing relatively overnight. As for me the two biggest changes was no more in person classes, and no more job. As for school, I used to drive a total 2-2.5 hours to and from school 4 days a week. That was a hassle to say the least. This doesn't inlcude gas cost and parking costs. After UH has shut down, all classes are now online, and it's a bit of challenge. I didn't think I would say it, but classes online just aren't as beneficial in terms of my learning. Not just for 314, but for all my classes, being in class is crucial for understanding the class material. Also the few friends I've made in some of my classes, I don't get to see anymore, which hurts not only my social life, but seeing classmates was helpful to catch up on due dates and other important information going on in classes. 
I used to work at Outback Steakhouse as a server, and for about a week or so we basically doubled down on our sanitation procedures, but after that, most all employees were furloughed including me. With no job I have to say I'm enjoying my free time more, becuase I'm able to study more anf at the times I want to and need to. However, my job also provided me with spending money, health insurance, and money to save for tuition. On top of that, I don't get to see any of my work friends anymore. Both my parents' jobs have also been highly affected by the pandemic procedures. My sister is an elementary school teacher, so she is fortunately still employed and working doing some online assignments to keep her kids busy. 
My daily routine has changed only slightly, because as it was, I used to spend a lot of time at home. I like to play video games, and watch movies and such. The major things I've noticed is I dont't go out to eat anymore and rarely get takeout/delivery. Also, I've started a workout routine at home becuase I have much more free time as stated earlier. Not only no work, but no driving, and for some classes, no zoom meetings or in person class. I used to go out to eat and drink with my girlfriend fairly often, but now we have nowhere to go, so sometimes we'll hangout on the weekends, but she still has to work online which is fortunate she is still employeed.

## Overall

I can't say I'm happy about the Corona Pandemic because it still is what it is, a potentially fatal global pandemic. Some of the changes in my life have been positive, but overall I am hoping it will end soon so I can really focus on my education in the way that's best suited to me: in person schooling.

# Overview

### The Problem
At UH Manoa, many students dorm, and do not have access to reliable transportation all the time. This can make it difficult for some to manage a list of everyday errands they need to do, such as buying food and clothes, doing laundrey, or going to work. 

### The Solution
With the help of some Aloha, this application will allow students and faculty alike to ask "runners" for any errands they need to get done. It will thrive in helping students who dorm and don't have reliable transportation. A user can post the task/errand they need to get done, and a runner can offer to do the errand for either a trade in service or for a small fee.

## Mockup Page Ideas

This application will mainly allow for two types of users. The ones asking for help in running errands and the runners who will run the errands. For both types of users there will be a login page to a home page. 
As for the customers asking for help: The homepage will be a list of any tasks they have already posted and a status that will tell them if someone is going to complete the task, is in the process or has been completed. A secondary page for the customers will be the page for them to post a new task. The page will prompt them with a form to complete consisting of: Title of task, Description, when they need the task to be completed possible location, and some symbol to indicate how much they expect to pay for the task. Third and final page will be a rating page where customers can rate and/or tip the runners that ran an errand for them. and ratings will be available to all other customers and to that runnner.
For the Runners, There will be a dynamic feed of tasks to be completed that customers will post to. This board is visible to all runners but not to the customers. Runnners can sort the tasks based on the date the task is needed or by how much money they could potentially make. They will also have an account page available to the customers to see where they can edit their profile, and list any special assets they can offer such as a truck for moving furniture etc.

## Cases

Say a customer needs to pick up dry cleaning but does not have time or a way of getting to the dry cleaner. The customer would login, go to the add task page fill out the form and post the task. This task is now added to her homepage of tasks to be completed. The task is now also posted to the feed available to the runners. Any runner can look at the task and decide if they want to do it. If they choose to do it, they can offer an amount to the customer to say "I will do this task for X dollars". The user gets notified of this and can either accept or decline. Once accepted or declined, the runner will be notified to either complete the task or not. After the task is complete they will both mark complete on the app and payment will proceed. The customer then has the option to rate and/or tip the runner. 

## Beyond the basics

 This app would be reliant on a notifcation system to allow users and runners to know what the status of a task is. Users would also be given the oppurtunity to mark tasks as urgent to send to the top of the feed for the runners to see first. This application should be available on both mobile and web but would probably do better no mobile given the reliance on notifcation system.

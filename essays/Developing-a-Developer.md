## What is Software Development

If someone outside the coding world heard about Software Devlopment and/or software developers we two words that we kind of know, but together are a mystery. Plain and simple software Development is... wait for it... developing, you guessed it, software. In this past semester we learned the basics of web applications, software development tools but more importantly, how to develop. Not just develop software but anything and everything. We learned a basic process to problem solving and project management that can be applied in all kinds of fields and areas. Within these project management ideas are key basic fundamentals on how to work in groups and as part of team towards one goal. All valuable and important lessons in any field but especially in the field of software development. 

## Functional Functions

More often than not, when learning new programming concepts or even new languages, your past knowledge that you've learned will be analogous to the new information you're going to learn. In other words, you can easily apply what you know to learn something new. This was not the case when learning functional programming, that is at least not for me. Functional programming for me, was a game-changing new mechanic that revolutionized writing code. It was both interesting to learn and is still something fun to use. 

## Web WOD

I can confidently say that before this class, I was as interested in Web development as could be yet knew next to nothing about it. After taking this class, I have learned enough about it to know that it is not the specific area I want to grow in for my hopeful,  hypothetical career. While it was interesting, to learn about all the cosmetics as well as the database side of things, I always feel like whatever task I'm doing, has already been done before, and probably much quicker than I am doing it. That being said I'm very glad I took the time to learn the fundamentals as I'm sure it will help me with learning different concepts in the future. Not only that but I feel that web development is one of the stepping stones to becoming a better computer scientist.

## Git Good

As we learn project management and software devlopment, we can't ignore (pun intended) github. Github is an amazing tool, that also had very little knowledge of befoer this class. After using it to work on my own projects, I was impressed, but when i started working with my team on our final project, it really blew me away. I knew what it could do, but until I experience it first hand, there's no true understanding. Learning Git hub alone, was worth taking this class, as I know that this will be around for a long time, and will be used in whatever specific computer science career path I choose. 

## Final Words

This class is a shining example of why I chose and love my major. Computer Science, is yes about computers, but in my opinion, It is much more about a way of thinking. It's about how to solve problems, use logic, how to really think and analyze, and how to think outside the box. It allows us to expand our thinking, in ways we never thought possible. And finally, in a more computer specific sense, it allows us an oppurtunity to shape our future.

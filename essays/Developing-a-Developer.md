## What is Software Devlopment

If someone outside the coding world heard about Software Devlopment and/or software developers we two words that we kind of know, but together are a mystery. Plain and simple software Development is... wait for it... developing, you guessed it, software. In this past semester we learned the basics of web applications, software development tools but more importantly, how to develop. Not just develop software but anything and everything. We learned a basic process to problem solving and project management that can be applied in all kinds of fields and areas. Within these project management ideas are key basic fundamentals on how to work in groups and as part of team towards one goal. All valuable and important lessons in any field but especially in the field of software development.

More often than not, when learning new programming concepts or even new languages, your past knowledge that you've learned will be analogous to the new information you're going to learn. In other words, you can easily apply what you know to learn something new. This was not the case when learning functional programming, that is at least not for me. Functional programming for me, was a game-changing new mechanic that revolutionized writing code.

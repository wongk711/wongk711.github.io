## Software Recipes

If we take a look at design patterns in software engineering, we can see it's really just an adaptation from the original idea of deisgn patterns which was not nexessarily meant for software development. This in itself is an amazing irony, that the "gang of four" took the book on design patterns to create a new book on design patterns specifically for software engineering. In essence using the design pattern concept to create new book on design patterns. Anyway, When reading about design patterns, the easiest way to think about it for me is like a recipe book. A recipe book is good for giving you ideas and forming the base of whatever dish you're trying to create. The recipes are designed to be played with, to be a little flexible, to be implemented with your own specifications. For example, Let's say you're having a party and need a pie. You go to your recipe book which gives instructions on how to make a cherry pie. However you know that you want apple, and you need two. You're still going to use the recipe book for the basics of the pie and are only going to change what you need to change to fit your needs. This is precisely analagous to deisgn patterns in software development. In writing code, there are often times when you run into a problem that has definitely occured before and more importantly has been solved before, by experienced coders. Maybe the context and specifications are different but the general idea of the solution is the same, and you can use that idea to solve your problem. It's smart and efficient because you know the general idea is correct so you don't have to waste time solving a problem that has been solved already. 

## Old Recipes

As a student, I have come across many many problems that have been solved before and have been wise (or lazy) enough to use those design patterns to solve my own problems. One of the easiest and most common examples is writing a paper for a class. Each and every prompt is going to be different, in fact evem the genre or writing style could differ, but in general the design pattern is going to be introduction, body, then conclusion. As a college student I've become so familiar with this design pattern that I implement it without even thinking about it anymore as I'm sure many people do. This has become a design pattern, because in the past, people have written many types of papers, and have found this to be a very effective and efficient method of getting what needs to be said heard. Now of course this is a solution to many problems of many different kinds of papers, however this does not solve all writing problems. For example, writing story, will be similar, but different in that there's a beginning, middle, and an end. Most all stories can be told in this fashion, however there are many stories that don't use this design pattern and start at the end then go to the beginning and then the middle to meet back at the end. 

## Conclusion

Design patterns are the basic recipe for a common problem that will occur again in the future. They are not a one size fits all, solve any problem, but like a baseline, to be modified to fit your problem. Design Patterns are constantly being used and formed and sometimes without even realizing it. Hopefully as I grow, I hope to fill my recipe book and to be able to utilize it frequently.

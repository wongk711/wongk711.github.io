This semester at UH Manoa, was still 100% online, at least for me. At this point I've gotten used to never leaving the house, classes through video chat, and discord being my main source of communication. These are sad truths of 2020-2021 school year. ICS 414 was designed to be a semester long project where you work with one group of 8 on the same project all semester long. I actually quite enjoyed this format of class as it felt like this is what actual work in the industry might feel like. The format of the class made it clear what was needed when and deadlines were well planned. </br>
I felt that my group worked well together despite not knowing each other at first. It felt like everyone pulled their fair share of the weight of work. At first I was skeptical that a group of 8 would be able to do this, as it seems like it'd be easy to sort of hide behind the others. A combination of good individual work ethic and healthy class competition I think encouraged us to work hard, and pull our weight. It also helps to know that the professor is tracking our commits on github as well as our Khanban project boards to track contributions.</br>
I think the best and coolest part of this class, was that we were in direct contact with people from HEI who gave us feedback on our projects. This allowed us to get a feel for what it might be like in a real job where we work with clients to understand what they want and communicate effectively. I feel that this also played a role in wanting to impress the clients with our work and what progress we've made.</br>
Overall, I'm really glad I took this class, it taught me a lot and I gained valuable experience. Before taking this course I had taken 314 and sort of knew that I didn't want to do web development, but after going through the whole process that this class provided I've since changed my mind and would consider this as a career path.

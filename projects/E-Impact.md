## Home Page

Our home page was pretty basic in its aesthetic but I belive in the simple beauty of things. This was simply a page to tell newcomers what our site could do and how to register, and a chance for existing users to sign in. This was one of my contributions to the project was building this page.

## Databases

We used a combination Meteor and Mongo DB to keep our databases. For example we had to keep databases of user's friends, their reminders, any scheduled study sessions they have, etc. This is an example of a users' friends page:

## Working as a Team 

As for my contribution, I took care of the website homepage, the landing page of the site, and the remin ders component of the site. This project we heavily relied on Github to manage different tasks and keep track of whos taking care of what. This was my first experience using github organizations as well as relying on github for version control across a whole team. After completing this project, I really love how easy github makes it, to work on a team. I remember working on a project in my freshman year on a shell project, with no github and we would meet once a week and compare our programs and change them all and do it again the next week. Anyway, loved the teamwork, and the project came out okay.

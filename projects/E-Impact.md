summary: Worked with team to create candidate website for HEI.
---

This was a semester long project for ICS 414 at UH Manoa. I worked in a group of 8 to create this Meteor, MongoDB, React based application for HEI. As I understand, HEI is to choose one of the groups projects for further development and later deployment.</br>
My main role in the group was developing the Daily Page which consisted of working with the MongoDB collections as well as Meteor's database to list trips taken by a particular user. Most of the components in the Daily page, I created with the help of React-Semantic-UI. The Daily Page also was the foundation for the Admin Daily page which was written later on.</br>
I also helped develop thousands of records of fake data for development and show testing purposes. My last major role was handling deployment including a custom Domain name.</br>

summary: Worked with team to build horror themed game from scratch in Unity.
---

I had a few major roles in the creation of the game. Firstly, I created a game on my own which was designed to be horror themed maze game which served as inspiration to this game. We took a few key concepts such as the flashlight in the dark, the maze, and the horror theme to create the new game. In this game we added Bugs to the horror theme, as well as combat rather than stealth. Our team consisted of two ICS students including me, and one ACM student who handled the 3D modeling, the art, and the animations.</br>
My major role in the development stage was creating the AI for the bugs, which include the Scarabs, the miniboss roach, the miniboss horseflies, and the big boss centipede. Most of my work was done using Bolt Scripting as per suggestion from the professor. Bolt is an asset in Unity which allows developers to use visual scripting rather than the standard C# scripting in Unity. At first I was skeptical of both limited functionality as well as speed/efficiency in scripting, however after getting the hang of things, it felt faster to develop scripts in Bolt than C#. Here's an example of what a single Bolt function might look like.

And here's the whole script:
